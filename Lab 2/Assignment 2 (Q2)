    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of web pages by marking up text and
        other media with tags and elements that browsers can understand and display. It serves as the foundation of
        nearly all websites, providing the basic layout for text, images, links, and multimedia, making it the universal
        language of the web.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>

    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language that is a core technology
        of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It is primarily known as the scripting language for web pages,
        enabling dynamic and interactive client-side behavior.</p>
